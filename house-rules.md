# Shadows Hunters House Rules

We’ve got some extra, just-for-fun twists — new combat styles, spicy damage rules, and one-time abilities to shake things up. But here’s the deal: **every player’s gotta be on board** and we lock them in **right after the game kicks off**. If you’re new, stick with the base rules for a round or two before turning on the crazy stuff.

## Use It or Lose It \[Easy\]

At the end of your turn, you must either play all **Single-use** cards in your hand or discard them.

---

## Duel Dice \[Easy\]

- Attacker rolls **1d6**.
- Defender rolls **1d4**.
- Damage = (higher result - lower result). If tied, damage is **0**.
- **Only applies to attacks** — does not affect damage from card effects, Area effects, or abilities

> **Masamune Interaction**: If the Attacker has **Masamune**, its effect overrides Duel Dice — the Attacker rolls only 1d4 for damage and the Defender does not roll.

---

## Critical Misses \[Easy\]

If both dice show the same number during an attack (damage = 0), the attacker suffers 1 damage from a blunder or backfire.

> **Note**: Critical Misses must be used together with the **Duel Dice** rule (attacker rolls 1d6, defender rolls 1d4). Only applies to attacks — not to damage from cards, Areas, or abilities

---

## Coup de Grâce \[Medium\]

When a defender takes damage and their **remaining HP** (after all calculations) is at or below the execution threshold for their base HP:

| Base HP | Execution threshold |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 10 - 11 | 1 HP or less        |
| 12 - 14 | 2 HP or less        |

### Execution Roll

1. The attacker may immediately roll **two separate 1d6**.
2. If **both rolls** result in **6**, the defender is instantly **eliminated** from the game regardless of remaining HP.

### Restriction

- Coup de Grâce can only be triggered **immediately** after the attacker deals damage and the defender’s HP drops to the trigger threshold. If this condition is not met at that exact moment, the effect **cannot** be activated later. This ability can only be declared on the same turn — once the **Attack Phase ends**, it cannot be declared even if the defender’s HP meets the threshold.
- Each player may only attempt Coup de Grâce **once per defender per game**.

### Example

- Defender starts with 12 HP. After damage, they are at 2 HP.
- They are in the execution range, so the attacker rolls two d6.
- Rolls come up 6 and 6 → Defender is eliminated.

---

## Last Stand \[Medium\]

> Interaction with Coup de Grâce
>
> - If both rules are active and a situation triggers both, Coup de Grâce is resolved first.
> - If the defender survives, Last Stand is then resolved.

When activated, the defender immediately makes a free counterattack against the attacker. Damage is calculated as normal.

- May only be used in response to **attacks** — not damage from cards, Areas, or abilities.
- Each player may only activate **Last Stand** once per game.

---

## Blur \[Advanced\]

A defensive maneuver that can be activated by the **defender** once per game when targeted by an **attack**.

**Activation**

- Defender declares **Blur** before the attacker rolls any dice.

**Resolution**

- Attacker rolls for damage **before applying Equipment or any additional damage bonuses**.
- Defender immediately rolls the same type of die used by the attacker (e.g., 1d6 if attacker rolled 1d6).
- If the defender’s roll is **equal to or higher** than the attacker’s roll, the attack is declared **missed** and the attacker’s turn ends immediately.
- If the defender’s roll is **lower**, the attack continues as normal, applying Equipment and other bonuses to the attacker’s damage.

**Restrictions**

- Blur only works against **attacks**, not damage from cards, Areas, or abilities.
- May only be used **once per game** per player.
- **Cannot be used after a Coup de Grâce is declared**.

---

## Double It or Lose It \[Advanced\] (Experimental)

**This rule is currently an Experimental rule and may be adjusted during or after the game for balance.**

- Before resolving any damage action (attack, card effect, Area effect, or ability), the player may declare **DOUBLE** to use this rule.
- When **DOUBLE** is declared:
  1. **All additional-damage Equipment effects are temporarily disabled** for this roll or effect.
  2. Resolve the damage roll or effect normally, without Equipment modifiers.
  3. If the base damage (before modifiers) is **≥ 1**, add **+2** damage to the result.
  4. If the base damage = 0, the player takes **base damage** (the rolled/effect result before +2) as a penalty instead.
- Equipment bonuses remain disabled for that damage action only; they reactivate for future turns/actions.
- May only be used **once per game** per player

> **Note**: If you use Double It or Lose It, it overrides **Critical Misses** for that attack — meaning you apply the penalty from this rule instead of the **Critical Misses** penalty.
>
> **Masamune Interaction**: If the Attacker has **Masamune** and declares **DOUBLE**,” roll only 1d4 for damage. After applying any reductions from the Defender’s Equipment or abilities, if final damage ≥ 1, add +2 to the result. If final damage = 0, apply the **Lose It** penalty.
