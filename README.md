# Shadows Hunters Rulebook

## 1. Overview

**Shadows Hunters** is a hidden-role survival game where each player belongs to one of three factions:

- **Hunters** - Win by eliminating all Shadows.
- **Shadows** - Win by eliminating all Hunters.
- **Neutrals** - Win by achieving the personal goal printed on your character card.

Roles are hidden at the start of the game. Players use deduction, deception, and combat to achieve their victory conditions.

> **Note**: In this rulebook, an **Area** is a specific place you can move to on the board, and a **Region** is a pair of Areas connected on the board.

## 2. Card & Component Types

### White Cards

- Contain mostly beneficial effects.
- Can include **Equipment** or **Single-use** cards.
- Often provide healing, defense, or weapon upgrades.
- More useful for Hunters, but can help any faction.

### Black Cards

- Contain mostly harmful effects.
- Can include **Equipment** or **Single-use** cards.
- Often cause damage, apply curses, or sabotage other players.
- More useful for Shadows, but can be used by anyone.

### Green Hermit Cards

- Never Equipment; always Single-use.
- Provide **indirect clues** about a player's faction.
- Effects depend on the target's faction and are resolved **secretly**.

> **Note**: Some Hermit cards mention specific base-game character names (e.g., “If your character is Alice or Byron…”). When playing with expansion characters, treat these as referring to **any character whose name begins with the same first letter**.
>
> Example:
>
> - "Alice" → Any character starting with **A**.
> - "Byron" → Any character starting with **B**.

### Equipment

Cards that stay in play and provide ongoing bonuses or abilities.

- Stay in play after being used.
- Placed face-up in front of the player.
- Provide continuous effects (e.g., reduce damage, increase attack power).
- A player can have multiple Equipment unless a card says otherwise.
- If you die, your Equipment can be taken by another player (usually the attacker).

### Single-use Cards

Cards that are played once for an immediate effect, then discarded.

- Resolved immediately when played.
- Discarded after effect is applied.
- Can be kept until you decide to use them or until you die.
- If the card text says **play immediately** you must resolve it as soon as it is drawn.
- If you die while holding Single-use cards, discard them without effect.
- Examples: instant damage, healing, or special attacks.

### Areas

- Represent locations on the board.
- Each **Area** is numbered 2–10. If you roll a total of 7, you may choose any **Area** instead of moving normally.
- You move to Areas by rolling dice **1d4 + 1d6**.
- Areas can give you cards, heal you, deal fixed damage, or allow you to interact with Equipment.

## 3. Area Effects

| Area Name           | Effect                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Underworld Gate** | Choose one deck (White, Black, or Green) and draw the top card.                                                                                                             |
| **Hermit's Cabin**  | Draw the top Green (Hermit) card. Give it face-down to any player. That player reads it, secretly follows its instructions, and discards it face-down without revealing it. |
| **Church**          | Draw the top White card. Cards that are played once for an immediate effect, then discarded.                                                                                |
| **Cemetery**        | Draw the top Black card.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Weird Woods**     | Choose one: Deal 2 damage to any player, or heal 1 HP to any player (cannot exceed max HP).                                                                                 |
| **Erstwhile Altar** | Choose another player and take one Equipment card they have in play. You may equip it immediately or keep it in your hand.                                                  |

## 4. Hermit Card Rules

- Hermit Cards give **indirect clues** about the receiver's faction.
- Instructions might cause healing, damage, or no effect depending on the target's team.
- The effect is resolved **secretly** — only the receiver knows the outcome.
- Giving Hermit cards is one of the main deduction tools in the game.
- If a Hermit card lists multiple possible factions or traits, follow the first that applies to you and ignore the rest.

> Note: Some Hermit cards mention specific base-game character names (e.g., “If your character is Alice or Byron…”). When playing with expansion characters, treat these as referring to any character whose name begins with the same first letter.
>
> Example:
>
> - "Alice" → Any character starting with A.
> - "Byron" → Any character starting with B.

## 5. Damage, Healing & Death

- If a player's HP reaches **0**, they immediately die.
- When you die:
  1. Reveal your Character Card face-up.
  2. Discard all cards in your hand.
  3. Drop all Equipment in play; if you were killed by an attack, **the attacker immediately claim one of your Equipment cards**.
- Dead players do not take turns but still count toward win conditions (for Neutrals that allow it).

---

## 6. Turn Sequence

The game proceeds in clockwise order. On your turn, perform these steps in order:

### Step 1: Move

- Roll **one 4-sided die (d4)** and **one 6-sided die (d6)**.
- Add the results to find your **movement total**.
- Move your piece to the **Area** with that number.
- **Special rules for movement**:
  - If your total is **7**, you may choose _any_ Area.
  - If your roll matches your current Area's number, reroll both dice until you get a different number.
- After moving, immediately **apply the effect** of your new Area.

### Step 2: Attack (Optional)

- You may choose to attack **one player** who is:
  - In the **same Area** as you, or
  - In an **adjacent Region** (as shown on the board's connections).
- **Damage Roll - Standard Rule**: The attacker rolls both a d6 and a d4.
  - Damage = (higher result - lower result).
  - If both dice show the same number, damage is **0**.
- The defender reduces their HP by the damage amount.

### Step 3: Use Abilities (Optional)

- Some characters have special abilities that can be activated under specific conditions.
- Abilities may occur before or after attacking, depending on the card text.
- Follow the exact wording on your character card.

- **Shadows**: Win immediately when all Hunters are dead.
- **Neutrals**: Win immediately when their unique win condition is met (even if they are dead).
- Multiple players may win at the same time if their conditions are fulfilled simultaneously.
